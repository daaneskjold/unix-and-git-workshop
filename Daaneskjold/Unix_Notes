This was my first time using Linux. I have heard a lot of it but I never had the time or motivation to use it before. So far it has been a pleasant surprise.

I am assuming that along the way of it's life cycle and after lots of colaborations from tons of people I am getting something that is way more refined that it was yesterday. It feels a lot like windows. And i mean. A lot. There are a few things that I like.
- The light weight feeling of it all
- The management of applications. Seems a lot like ngt packages. It's way less cumbersome than the windows way.

Things i dont like:
- My sound drivers dont seem to work? need to check that.

Anyway, as for my terminal learnings. I can relate many of those with stuff in the windows console. ls (dir), cd(same), mkdir (same), gzip (this one is nice), and so on. I am still a basic user so i have pretty much just been using the basic directory commands. I expect to get more experience in the future.

Oh, and I love fish. Makes everything so much more visual. I need to see if Windows has something like that because it is one of those things that might spoil you.
